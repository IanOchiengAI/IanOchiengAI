### Hi there 👋, I'm Ian!

I simlify AI for practical results. I specialize in turning manual processes and messy data into automated, intelligent systems using Large Language Models.

**🚀 My Mission:** I solve real-world business problems to help companies save time, reduce costs, and become more efficient. I'm currently building a portfolio of high-impact proof-of-concept projects.
